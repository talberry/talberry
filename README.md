# Hi, I’m Tal! 👋

I’m a student passionate about software engineering, always eager to learn and build new things. My main experience is with Python, TypeScript, React/Next.js, Express.js, OAuth, and more—but I'm always looking for new tools and challenges!

## 🚀 Projects & Highlights

- Contributed a deployed MCP server to the [@descope/ai](https://github.com/descope/ai) repo.
- Building an education platform at [aztec-assess](https://github.com/adaptive-testers/aztec-assess/).
- Created and maintain [reflex-descope-auth](https://github.com/descope-sample-apps/reflex-descope-auth)—one of my favorite projects!
- Experimenting with [link-a-doodle](https://github.com/talberry/link-a-doodle).

## 🌍 Open Source Contributions

I enjoy collaborating on open source and have contributed a customer-requested feature across multiple official Descope SDKs. This feature added tenant/role search parameters to user search—improving flexibility for developers across the Descope ecosystem:
